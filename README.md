# Phi
Phi — a bare-metal 2D physics sandbox written in Java. No frameworks, no nonsense. Just pure motion.
Just so everyone knows, Java is the first big language I learnt, and so I always enjoy working with it.
So I thought, why not try a Physics engine?
Right now, it's only a 2D version, but I'll definitely come back to make it 3D!
If you're completely lost like me, enjoy!
